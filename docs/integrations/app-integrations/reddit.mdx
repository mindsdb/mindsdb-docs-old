This is the implementation of the Reddit app handler for MindsDB. It provides interfaces to connect to Reddit via APIs and pull data into MindsDB.

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a network of communities based on people's interests. It provides a platform for users to submit links, create content, and discuss various topics.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the [PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, which is a Python package that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to access the Reddit API.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `client_id` is a Reddit API client ID.
* `client_secret` is a Reddit API client secret.
* `user_agent` is a user agent string to identify your application.

<Tip>
Here is how to get your Reddit credentials:

1. Go to Reddit App Preferences at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps or https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click *create another app...*
3. Fill out the form with the name, description, and redirect URL for your app, then click *create app*
4. Now you should be able to see the personal user script, secret, and name of your app. Store those as environment variables: `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `USER_AGENT`, respecitvely.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/reddit_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Reddit app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_reddit
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'reddit',
    PARAMETERS = {
     "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
     "user_agent": "YOUR_USER_AGENT"
    };
```

It creates a database that comes with two tables: `submission` and `comment`.

Now you can fetch data from Reddit, like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_reddit.submission
WHERE subreddit = 'MachineLearning'
AND sort_type = 'top'                   -- specifies the sorting type for the subreddit (possible value include 'hot', 'new', 'top', 'controversial', 'gilded', 'wiki', 'mod', 'rising')
AND items = 5;                          -- specifies the number of items to fetch from the subreddit
```

You can also fetch comments for a particular post/submission, like this:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_reddit.comment
WHERE submission_id = '12gls93'
```
