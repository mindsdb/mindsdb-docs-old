This is the implementation of the Plaid app handler for MindsDB. It helps you automate the financial data processing.

[Plaid](https://plaid.com/) helps all companies build fintech solutions by making it easy, safe and reliable for people to connect their financial data to apps and services.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `client_id`
* `secret`
* `access_token`
* `plaid_env`

<Tip>
You can get the `client_id`, `secret`, and `access_token` values [here](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/keys) once you sign in to your Plaid account.
And [here](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#itempublic_tokenexchange) is how you generate the `access_token` value.
</Tip>

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/plaid_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Plaid app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_plaid 
WITH 
    ENGINE = 'plaid',
    PARAMETERS = {
      "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      "secret": "YOUR_SECRET",
      "access_token": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
      "plaid_env": "ENV"
    };
```

It creates a database that comes with two tables: `transactions` and `balance`.

Now you can query your data, like this:

```sql
SELECT id, merchant_name, authorized_date, amount, payment_channel
FROM my_plaid.transactions 
WHERE start_date = '2022-01-01' 
AND end_date = '2023-04-11' 
LIMIT 20;
```

And if you want to use functions provided by the Plaid API, you can use the native queries syntax, like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_plaid (
  get_transactions(
    start_date = '2022-01-01',
    end_date = '2022-02-01'
  )
);
```
