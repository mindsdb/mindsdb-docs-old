In this section, we present how to integrate a Gmail account with MindsDB.

<Warning>
Please note that currently you can connect your Gmail account to local MindsDB installation by providing a path to the credentials file stored locally.

If you want to connect your Gmail account to MindsDB Cloud, you can upload the credentials file, for instance, to your S3 bucket and provide a link to it as a parameter.
</Warning>

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials_file` local path to the credentials.json or `s3_credentials_file` in case your file is uploaded to s3. Follow the instructions below to generate the credentials file.
* `scopes` define the level of access granted. It is optional and by default it uses 'https://.../gmail.compose' and 'https://.../gmail.readonly' scopes.
* 
<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/gmail_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Google Calendar app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_gmail
WITH ENGINE = 'gmail',
parameters = {
    "credentials_file": "mindsdb/integrations/handlers/gmail_handler/credentials.json",
    "scopes": ['https://.../gmail.compose', 'https://.../gmail.readonly', ...]
};
```

Or, you can also connect by giving the credentials file from an s3 [pre signed url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html). To do this you need to pass in the credentials_file parameter as a [pre signed url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html). For example:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_gmail
WITH ENGINE = 'gmail',
parameters = {
    "s3_credentials_file": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/your_bucket/credentials.json?response-content-disposition=inline&X-Amz-Security-Token=12312...",
    -- "scopes": ['SCOPE_1', 'SCOPE_2', ...] -- Optional scopes. By default 'https://.../gmail.compose' & 'https://.../gmail.readonly' scopes are used
};
```

<Tip>
You need a Google account in order to use this integration. Here is how to get the credentials file:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:

    1.1 Go to the GCP Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    
    1.2 If you haven't created a project before, you'll be prompted to do so now.
    
    1.3 Give your new project a name.
    
    1.4 Click `Create` to create the new project.

2. Enable the Gmail API:

    2.1 In the GCP Console, select your project.

    2.2 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Library`.

    2.3 In the search bar, search for `Gmail`.

    2.4 Click on `Gmail API`, then click `Enable`.

3. Create credentials for the Gmail API:

    3.1 Navigate to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.

    3.2 Click on the `Create Credentials` button and choose `OAuth client ID`.

    3.3 If you haven't configured the OAuth consent screen before, you'll be prompted to do so now. Make sure to choose `External` for User Type, and select the necessary scopes. Make sure to save the changes.
    Now, create the OAuth client ID. Choose `Desktop app` for the Application Type and give it a name.

    3.4 Click `Create`.

4. Download the JSON file:

    4.1 After creating your credentials, click the download button (an icon of an arrow pointing down) on the right side of your client ID. This will download a JSON file, so you will use the location to it in the `credentials_file` param.

## Usage

This creates a database called mindsdb_gmail. This database ships with a table called emails that we can use to search for emails as well as to write emails.

Now you can use your Gmail data, like this:

* searching for email:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM mindsdb_gmail.emails
    WHERE query = 'alert from:*@google.com'
    AND label_ids = "INBOX,UNREAD"
    LIMIT 20;
    ```

* writing emails:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO mindsdb_gmail.emails (thread_id, message_id, to_email, subject, body)
    VALUES ('187cbdd861350934d', '8e54ccfd-abd0-756b-a12e-f7bc95ebc75b@Spark', 'test@example2.com', 'Trying out MindsDB',
            'This seems awesome. You must try it out whenever you can.');
    ```

## Example 1: Automating Email Replies

Now that we know how to pull emails into our database and write emails, we can make use of OpenAPI engine to write email replies.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.gpt_model
PREDICT response
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    max_tokens = 500,
    api_key = 'your_api_key', 
    model_name = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    prompt_template = 'From input message: {{body}}\
                        by from_user: {{sender}}\
                        In less than 500 characters, write an email response to {{sender}} in the following format:\
                        Start with proper salutation and respond with a short message in a casual tone, and sign the email with my name mindsdb';
```

## Example 2: Detecting Spam Emails

You can check if an email is spam by using one of the Hugging Face pre-trained models.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.spam_classifier                           
PREDICT PRED                           
USING
  engine = 'huggingface',              
  task = 'text-classification',        
  model_name = 'mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-sms-spam-detection', 
  input_column = 'text_spammy',        
  labels = ['ham', 'spam'];
```

Then, create a view that contains the snippet or the body of the email.

```sql
CREATE VIEW mindsdb.emails_text AS(
    SELECT snippet AS text_spammy
    FROM mindsdb_gmail.emails
);
```

Finally, you can use the model to classify emails into spam or ham:

```sql
SELECT h.PRED, h.PRED_explain, t.text_spammy AS input_text
FROM mindsdb.emails_text AS t
JOIN mindsdb.spam_classifier AS h;
```
