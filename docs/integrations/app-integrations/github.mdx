In this section, we present how to integrate a GitHub repository with MindsDB.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the `pygithub` library, a Python library that wraps GitHub API v3.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `repository` is the GitHub repository name.
* `api_key` is an optional GitHub API key to use for authentication.
* `github_url` is an optional GitHub URL to connect to a GitHub Enterprise instance.

<Tip>
Check out [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) on how to create the GitHub API key.

It is recommended to use the API key to avoid the `API rate limit exceeded` error.
</Tip>

Here is how to connect the MindsDB GitHub repository:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_github
WITH ENGINE = 'github',
PARAMETERS = {
  "repository": "mindsdb/mindsdb"
};
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/github_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

The `mindsdb_github` connection contains two tables: `issues` and `pull_requests`.

Here is how to query for all issues:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb_github.issues;
```

You can run more advanced queries to fetch specific issues in a defined order:

```sql
SELECT number, state, creator, assignee, title, labels
FROM mindsdb_github.issues
WHERE state="all"
ORDER BY created ASC, creator DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

And the same goes for pull requests:

```sql
SELECT number, state, title, creator, head, commits
FROM mindsdb_github.pull_requests
WHERE state="all"
ORDER BY long_running DESC, commits DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
